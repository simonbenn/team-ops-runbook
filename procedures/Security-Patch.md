Security-patching-guide
Here is a 50-word Linux security patching guide:

Regularly update packages using your distro’s manager: `apt update && apt upgrade` or `yum/dnf update`. Enable automatic security updates where possible. Review vendor advisories and prioritize critical patches. Test updates on a staging system before production. Reboot when required, verify service status, and document all applied patches.
